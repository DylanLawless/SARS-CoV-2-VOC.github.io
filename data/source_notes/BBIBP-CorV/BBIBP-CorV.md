## BBIBP-CorV, Beijing Institute of Biological Products, Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine.

There is no evidence of the viral genetic sequence used in the production of this vaccine. 
The primary literature describes the process in detail, however the genetics are not published.
There is no sign in supplemental data, or on data repository which is aid to contain "all data in this study".


> BBIBP-CorV was developed by the Beijing Institute of Biological Products (Beijing, China), and manufactured as previously described.13 At the time of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, we isolated three SARS-CoV-2 strains from the bronchoalveolar lavage samples or throat swabs of three patients admitted to hospital (Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Chongqing Wushan County People's Hospital, or Qingdao Binhai New District Hospital). We selected strain 19nCoV-CDC-Tan-HB02 (HB02) to develop an inactivated vaccine because of its optimal replication and high virus yields in Vero cells, when compared with the other two strains. The HB02 strain was purified and passaged in Vero cells to generate the stock for vaccine production by using a novel carrier in a basket reactor. The stock virus replicated efficiently and reached a peak titre over 7·0 log10 cell culture infectious dose 50% assay by 48–72 h post infection at multiplicities of infection of 0·01–0·3. To inactivate virus production, β-propionolactone was thoroughly mixed with the harvested viral solution at a ratio of 1:4000 at 2–8°C. The vaccine was manufactured as a liquid formulation containing 2 μg, 4 μg, or 8 μg total protein with aluminium hydroxide adjuvant (0·45 mg/mL) per 0·5 mL.

>  We therefore chose the HB02 strain for the further devel- opment of the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (BBIBP-CorV). The comparisons on the whole-genome sequences of the HB02 strain and other SARS-CoV-2 strains from domestic and international sources showed that the HB02 strain is homologous to other viral strains and demonstrated that the main protective antigen (the spike protein) has 100% homology, indicating potential broad pro- tection against various SARS-CoV-2 strains (Figures S1 and S2).

> We isolated three SARS-CoV-2 strains from the bronchoalveolar lavage samples or throat swabs of three hospitalized patients from the recent COVID-19 outbreak to develop preclinical in vitro neutralization and challenge models for an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate (Lu et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). The three strains were 19nCoV-CDC-Tan-HB02 (HB02), 19nCoV-CDC-Tan-Strain03 (CQ01), and 19nCoV-CDC-Tan- Strain04 (QD01), which are scattered on the phylogenetic tree constructed from all available sequences, suggesting coverage of the main SARS-CoV-2 populations (Figure S1).
