## Aims and results overview
* To produce standardized alignments of vaccine sequences.
* Determine which are at risk to emerging variants.

From the data presented within:

1. The translated amino acid sequences for all vaccines were derived.
2. These were aligned to the SARS-CoV-2 reference amino acid sequences of spike (S) glycoprotein.
3. Known variants-of-concern were then annotated and visualised.

Variants-of-concern for five SARS-CoV-2 strains 
([CDC 4 Jun 2021](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/variant-info.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fcases-updates%2Fvariant-surveillance%2Fvariant-info.html))
are illustrated against the 
translated amino acid sequences of the vaccines; 

* Moderna mRNA-1273
* Pfizer/BioNTech BNT-162b2
* Janssen/Johnson & Johnson Ad26.COV2-S
* Novavax NVX-CoV2373
* Curevac CVnCoV
* Sputnik V
* AstraZeneca AZD1222

and reference protein/genome sequences;

* QHD43416.1 [MN908947.3] and
* YP\_009724390.1 [NC\_045512.2].

The variants-of-concern are shown here, illustrated on the protein structure;

Two of the defining genetic features that are different between vaccines are seen here, 
* the S glycoprotein furin cleavage modification region (p.682-685)

* the S glycoprotein stabilization modification region (p.986-987)
