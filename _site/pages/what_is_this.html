<h2 id="what-is-this">What is this?</h2>

<p>From humble research work to commercially-backed global vaccination, the scale of work in controlling COVID-19 due to SARS-CoV-2 infection has been vital and admirable. 
However, publication credibility is dependent on accurate scientific reporting. 
Vaccine producers have, in most cases, provided a description of their vaccine genetic sequence design in the primary literature. 
Release of coding sequence data is therefore not a matter of intellectual property protection.
It is concerning that all primary publications do not include the full coding sequence used.
Providing instead, only a description of variants introduces a hurdle to interpretation and detracts from scientific credibility.</p>

<p>The scientific community has a responsibility not only to measure post-vaccination susceptibility to new viral strains, but to determine <em>why</em> vaccine resistance may occur in reference to the vaccine coding sequence.
Currently, all vaccine genetic sequences have been almost identical (the main differences being modifications to the stabilization and furin cleavage regions). 
We want to be able to easily compare the genetic design of each vaccine.
We have taken the responsibility of providing this data publicly - 
to answer our own call <em>“genetics on the table, please”.</em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“I am too familiar with the manner in which actual data are met with the suggestion that <em>other data, if they were collected, might show something else</em> to believe it to have any value as an argument. “Statistics on the table, please,” can be my sole reply. —Karl Pearson, 1910” Excerpt From: Stigler S.M. <a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/Statistics-on-the-Table/9780674009790">Statistics on the table the history of statistical concepts and methods.</a></p>

<p>Naturally, each vaccine has a different efficacy; a variable level of protection from infection and immunological response.
Should a vaccine-resistant strain develop, the resistance will be defined by the vaccine coding sequence.
Vaccine efficacy, vaccine genetic design, and variant strain are all related but we should not confound the facts.</p>

<p>There are two major steps for preparedness.
Step 2 has been largely ignored.</p>

<ol>
  <li>When determining the protection provided by currently used vaccines
to circulating strains efficacy information is a <em>primary</em> requirement.</li>
  <li>When determining the possibility of vaccine resistance,
efficacy information is a <em>secondary</em> requirement.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Step 1 is commonly understood in popular media.</li>
  <li>Step 2 is described as follows:</li>
</ul>

<p>It is difficult to avoid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding">confounding</a> in step 2.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Let X be some independent variable, and Y some dependent variable. To estimate the effect of X on Y, the statistician must suppress the effects of extraneous variables that influence both X and Y. We say that X and Y are confounded by some other variable Z whenever Z causally influences both X and Y.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Z (new variant strain) may be more or less virulent or pathogenic.</li>
  <li>X (vaccine efficacy) offers a certain level of protection from a strain.</li>
  <li>Y (vaccine coding sequence) may or may not produce an immunological response that responds to a variant strain.</li>
</ul>

<p>For Z (variant strain) that develops a mutation in S protein that is no longer represented by the Y (vaccine coding sequence), the vaccine resistance is independent of X (vaccine efficacy).</p>

<p><em>Note: efficacy is defined based on the studies that have been previously conducted.</em></p>

<p>For all Y (vaccine coding sequence) that share the same sequence, all such vaccines will be equally genetically susceptible to this new Z (vaccine-resistance variant strain).</p>

<p>It is imperative to be able to identify vaccine resistance in multiple vaccines due to shared coding sequences.</p>

<p>At this stage, the <em>new measurements of efficacy for variant strains</em> can be determined.
Efficacy is then used as a secondary requirement for step 2.</p>
