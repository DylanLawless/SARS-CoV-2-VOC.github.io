	- Adenovirus serotype 26 (Ad26) viral vector vaccine
	- Expressing a modified S protein.
	- S protein of SARS-CoV-2 corresponding to positions 21,536–25,384 in SARS-CoV-2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 (genome MN908947 (18-MAR-2020))[Published](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41541-020-00243-x).
	- For Ad26.S.PP, the two stabilising variants p.(Lys986_Val987delinsProPro) are included as well as two mutations in the furin cleavage site that preserve the prefusion conformation and blocks shedding of S1.  
	- The furin cleavage site was abolished by amino acid changes p.R682S and p.R685G.
	- Stabiliazation by proline substitutions p.K986P, p.V987P.
	- [HGVS notation](https://varnomen.hgvs.org/recommendations/protein/variant/delins/) would be: p.[Arg682Ser;p.Arg685Gln] and p.(Lys986_Val987delinsProPro).

* Novavax: NVX-CoV2373
	- A protein subunit vaccine containing a doubly modified S protein, with adjuvant.
	- Part of a 27.2nm nanoparticle. 
	- S protein of SARS-CoV-2 corresponding to GenBank MN908947 nucleotides 21563-25384 [as published](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7584426/).
	- Contains the modified S protein with the two Proline substitutions, K986P and V987P. Additionally, three amino acids are changed (682-RRAR-685 to 682-QQAQ-685) to protect the protein against proteases.
	- [HGVS notation](https://varnomen.hgvs.org/recommendations/protein/variant/delins/) would be: p.[Arg682_Arg683delinsGlnGln;Arg685Gln] and p.(Lys986_Val987delinsProPro),
a simple list would even be better: p.R682Q, p.R683Q, p.R685Q, p.K986P, and p.V987P.
	- Saponin-based Matrix-M adjuvent.
	- Protein expression by a baculovirus in an Sf9 insect infection culture.
