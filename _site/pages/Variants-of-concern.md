## Variants-of-concern

SARS-CoV-2 Variant Classifications and Definitions were derived from 
[www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/variant-info.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fcases-updates%2Fvariant-surveillance%2Fvariant-info.html)

This dataset includes:

* Variants of Interest (VOI)
* Variants of Concern (VOC)
* Variants of High Consequence (VOHC)

The reformatted tables are presented in files:

[variants_of_concern.xlsx](../data/variants_of_concern.xlsx)
[variants_of_concern.csv](../data/variants_of_concern.csv)

There are currently no VOHC. 
VOC (but not VOI) were presented in the final visualisation.
